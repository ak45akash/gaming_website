## Overview

The **Gaming Websitk** is a sample React application optimized for speed and ease of development. It showcases how to use:

1. **Vite** for fast bundling and development.  
2. **React** (v19) for component-based UI.  
3. **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling.  
4. **GSAP** + *@Gsap/react** for smooth, professional-grade animations.


Whether youre building a gaming-themed landing page or any other high-impact web experience, this project demonstrates a clean setup you can build upon.
